\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	This paper presents a new method for the anisotropic remeshing of 3D surfaces.
	Starting from an densely sampled 3D mesh, the method build a curvature dependent 
	tensor field, which defines a Riemannian metric that drives the seeding of triangles.
	The core of the algorithm is a interleaving of geodesic farthest point seeding and 
	a geodesic Lloyd relaxation. This allows for a high quality placement of points according to the metric, 
	and the estimation of an anisotropic geodesic Delaunay triangulation.

\section{Introduction}

This paper tackles the difficult problem of meshing a surface with anisotropic triangles. 
Both the density and anisotropic of the triangles should be adapted to capture the complex regularity of 
a 3D surface.

\subsection{Surfaces as Riemannian Manifolds}

We consider here a smooth
surface $\surf \subset \RR^3$ embedded into the 3D Euclidean space.

To define the length of a curve drawn on the surface, a tensor $\tensor{x} \in \RR^{3 \times 3}$ is attached to 
each point $x \in \surf$. This tensor allows one to compute the length of a vector according to 
\eq{
	\normT{u}{\tensor{x}}^2 =  \dotpT{u}{u}{\tensor{x}}
	\qwhereq
	\dotpT{u}{v}{\tensor{x}} = 
	\dotp{\tensor{x} u}{v} = \sum_{1 \leq i,j \leq d} (\tensor{x})_{i,j} u_i v_j.
}
Since this tensor is intended to measure length of tangent to curves traced on the surface, it is assumed to be vanishing on the normal direction $n_x$ at $x$, which means $\normT{u}{\tensor{x}} = 0$.

The length of a curve $\ga : [0,1] \rightarrow \surf$ traced on the surface is then defined as
\eql{\label{eq-length-surf-embedding} 
	\length(\ga) = \int_0^1
  		\normT{\ga'(t)}{\tensor{\ga(t)}} \d t, 		} 
where $\ga'(t) \in \tangentPlane_{\ga(t)} \subset \RR^3$ is the derivative vector, 
that lies in the embedding space $\RR^3$,
and is in fact a vector belonging to the 2D tangent plane $\tangentPlane_{\ga(t)}$ to the surface at
$\ga(t)$.

The geodesic distance between two points $\xstart,\xend \in \surf$ is the length of the shortest curve joining the two points 
\eql{\label{eq-dfn-geodesic-dist}
	d(\xstart,\xend) = \umin{\ga \in \joining(\xstart,\xend)} \length(\ga)
}
where we use the following set of piecewise smooth curves 
\eq{
	\joining(\xstart,\xend) = \enscond{\ga : [0,1] \rightarrow \surf}{\ga(0)=\xstart, \ga(1)=\xend}.
}
A curve $\ga^\star$ satisfying $d(\xstart,\xend) = \length(\ga^\star)$ is called a shortest path, sometimes also referred to as a (globally minimizing) geodesic.
