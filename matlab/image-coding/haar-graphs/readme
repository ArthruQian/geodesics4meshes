This is just a very simple multiscale orthogonal transform for signals defined on graphs.

It recursively merge edges in the graph, and tries to perform the merging uniformly so that the size of the wavelet
progressively increases with the number of the wavelet.

The resulting wavelet are binary, so that thresholding of the coefficient produces a piecewise constant approximation.
